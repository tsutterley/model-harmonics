Overview
========

This documentation is intended to explain how to compute spherical harmonics from model
outputs for comparing with or correcting time-variable gravity measurements from the
`GRACE/GRACE-FO <https://github.com/tsutterley/gravity-toolkit>`_ missions.
This software was developed with the goal of supporting science applications for
time-variable gravity.

The ``model-harmonics`` projects consists of extension routines for the set of ``gravity-toolkit`` tools.
